# WG-bots

This is a collection of three bots that I used to search for (shared) flats in Munich. The bots are inspired by [immobot](https://github.com/nickirk/immo).

## wgzimmerbot

This bot searches on the platform wg-gesucht.de for new rooms and sends you a notification email. This is approximately 10 minutes faster than the built-in notification system. 

## wgwohnungsbot

This bot searches on the platform wg-gesucht.de for new flats and contacts them directly with a prespecified message with a personalized name. 

## wochenanzeigerbot

This bot searches the [Wochenanzeiger](https://www.wochenanzeiger.de/mietangebote/) for new offers and sends you a notification email.
